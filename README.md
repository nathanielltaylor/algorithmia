Testing out some of Algorithmia's most popular offerings for my own future use. Currently includes:
- PageRank (within a domain): Useful for thinking about UX of more complex applications
- Language Detection: Very fast, seems to be highly accurate
- Nudity Detection: Highly inaccurate based on my tests
